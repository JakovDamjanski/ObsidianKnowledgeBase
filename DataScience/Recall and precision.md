Precision, defined as  $Precision=\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$ shows us how accurately our model predicts the true class of the data. 

Recall defined as $Recall=\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$ , shows us the probability that a sample will be correctly classified by our model.


In situations where we want to have a high price to pay if our model makes mistakes (example: earthquake-prediction, cancer cell detection), it is better to maximise recall, rather than precision. 


Maximising recall is the equivalent of minimising false negatives.
Maximising precision is the equivalent of minimising false positives.

Important functions which are derivatives of Recall are [[Sensitivity and specificity]]
