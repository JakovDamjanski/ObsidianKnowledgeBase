The source of missing values in data can lead to the major types of missingness: 
- Missing completely at random (MCAR) - The probability of the missingness is the same for all entries. (Akin to randomly removing an attributes from an entry from the dataset)
- Missing at random (MAR) - The probability of missingness in a variable depends on other variables. (There is a correlation between the missingness of the variable and the value of an other variable or values of other variables (these variables are available information)).
- Missing not at random (MNAR)- The probability of missingness depends on information that has not been recorded  (it's not available to us)and this information also predicts the missing values.
- Structurally missing
