R squared or the coefficient of determination is a metric which measures how close our model for estimating is to the accuracy we would have if we would have used the mean as model.

The R squared coefficient is 0 if the model has the same mean squared error as the mean value. The R squared coefficient is 1 if the model is perfect. 
A negative value is possible for the R squared coefficient if we calculate it over the test set (we calculate it on unseen data, (and our model is trash)).
