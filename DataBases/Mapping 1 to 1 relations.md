There are three ways in which we can map a 1:1 relationship between entity types R' and S':
- add a primary key of R' into the r into the S'  schema. (Recommended to always pick R' is R' is with total participation in the relationship)
- Make a merged schema for both entity types. (This is possible only if both entity types are with total participation within the relationship)
- Create a new schema consisted of the both primary keys of the entity types.
