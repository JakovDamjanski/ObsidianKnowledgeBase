A __relationship__ concerns two or more different entities with different meaning.

Relationships of a same type are grouped into relationship types.

The degree oof a relationship is the number of entities that participate in the given relationship.

In a [[ER model ]] diagram relationships are displayed as rhombuses.


## Constraints within a relationship

Also known as structural constraints they are:
- Cardinality - determines the maximal number of participating entities in a given relationship (e.g. 1:1, 1:N, M:N).
- Participation constraints

The cardinality of the relationship is displayed by writing the number of entities that participate in a given instance of a relationship next to the corresponding side of the rhombus (the rhombus is connected with lines to the appropriate entities).


## Participation constraints within a relationship

The participation of an entity type in a relationship can be:
- Total - displayed within the diagram with a double line, the existence of the entity connected with the double line depends on the relationship.
- Partial - displayed with a single line, the existence of the entity does not depend on the relationship.

## Relationship attributes

Some kinds of relationships also possess attributes, they are most common in M:N cardinality relationships, but also appear on 1:N cardinality relationships (in this case, the attributes are transferred to the entity at the N side of the relationship). 


## Relationships with higher multiplicity
