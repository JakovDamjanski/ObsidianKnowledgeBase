This process is consisted of the following steps:
	1. Map the regular entity types 
	2. Map the weak entity types ([[Mapping weak entity types]])
	4. Map the binary 1:1 relationships([[Mapping 1 to 1 relations]])
	5. Map the binary 1:N relationships([[Mapping 1 to N relationships]])
	6. Map the binary M:N relationships([[Mapping M to N relationsips]])
	7. Map the multi-valued attributes([[Mapping multi valued attributes]])
	8. Map the N-ary relations([[Mapping N-ary relations]])
	9. [[Options to map specializations and generalizations]]
