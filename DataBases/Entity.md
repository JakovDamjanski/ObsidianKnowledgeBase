## Entity 
Entities are specific objects within the MiniWorld which are represented in the database. 
Entities of a same kind are grouped in one **entity type** . An __entity type__ defines a set of entities which possess the same attributes.

Entity types within [[ER model]] diagrams are displayed within rectangular boxes.

Weak entity types are entities that do not posses key attributes. 
These entity types have to be in a identifying () relationship type with a owner entity, which we refer to as a identifying or owner entity type.

Both the identifying relationship and the weak entity type are represented with double borders within the [[ER model]] diagrams.
