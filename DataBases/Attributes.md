## Attributes 
Attributes are characteristics which are used to describe the entity.
Every particular entity has specific values for each one of its attributes.
Every attribute also has a specific datatype and domain of possible values associated with it.

There are three types of attributes: 
- Simple - every entity has a atomic (non-divisible) value for the given attribute. (e.g. gender or SSN)
- Composite - The attribute itself is consisted of multiple components, which can too be composite attributes. (e.g. Address(Apt#, House#, Street, City, State, ZipCode, Country) or Name(FirstName, MiddleName, LastName))
- Multi-valued - When one entity can have multiple values for a given attribute.
(e.g. PreviousDegrees (we denote it as {PreviousDegrees} to emphasise that it's multi-valued), a student can have multiple previous degrees)

Attributes within the [[ER model]] diagram are displayed within elliptical bubbles. 

### Key attribute 
An attribute for a certain type of entity, which is unique for every entity is called a key attribute for a given entity type.

The name of the key attribute within the [[ER model]]  diagram is always underlined.
