A relationship R is in 3NF if there is a functional dependency X-> which is true for R, then either:
- X is a Super-key of R
- A is a primary attribute (part of any key in R).

There is some degree of redundancy if the relationship is in 3NF. (except if its in BCNF)

The way to take a relationship into 3NF is to find a minimal closure, but that is not covered in this course.
