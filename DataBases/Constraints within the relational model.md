There are three main types of constraints in the relational model which refer to:
- Key constraints - the uniqueness of the key within a relationship
- Entity integrity constraints - The primary key within every relationship cant have null values for any entry.
- Referential integrity constraints - a foreign key cannot reference to a non-existent entry within its relationship (there is an exception to this when there are ).
