Let $v_1,v_2,...v_p$ be [[vectors]] in $R^n$. Then the set of all linear combinations of these vectors is called the linear span of the vectors $v_1,v_2,...v_p$. (A subset of $R^n$ that can be generated by $v_1,v_2,...v_p$). We denote this as $span\{v_1,v_2,...,v_p\}$ 

## Geometrical interpretation of spans in 3D space
- If we have only one vector its span is a line that passes through the origin.
- If we have two vectors that are not collinear, their span is plane that passes through the origin.
- If we have three linearly independent ([[linear independence]]) vectors, their span is the whole 3D space (i.e. we can express any point in three dimensional space).
