## Linear equation definition:
Equation of type:
$a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n = b$ (1)
where $b,a_i,x_i \in R$ is a linear equation with n unknowns.


## Solution of a linear equation definition: 
A solution of a linear equation is the tuple $(s_1,s_2,...,s_n)$ with the property that (1)  is satisfied if we set $x_1=s_1,x_2=s_2,...,x_n=s_n$ .

## System of linear equations definition: 
A system of m linear equations with n unknows is a set of m linear equations with n unknowns.
This system can be written as:
$a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + ... + a_{1n}x_n = b_1$
$a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + ... + a_{2n}x_n = b_2$
$...$
$a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + ... + a_{mn}x_n = b_m$

## Solutions of a system of linear equations

#### A single solution: 
A tuple of $(s_1,s_2,...,s_n)$ that is a solution for all linear equations in the system.

#### A set of solutions:
A set including all of the possible tuples $(s_1,s_2,...,s_n)$, where each tuple is a solution to all linear equation in the system.

## Possible outcome for a system of linear equations:
1. No solution
2. Has only one solution
3. Has an infinite amount of solutions

If the given system has at least one solution it is referred to as a __consistent__ system.

If the given system has no solutions it is referred to as a __inconsistent__ system.

## Equivalent systems

Two systems are equivalent if the solution for the first one are also solutions for the second one, and vice versa.

#### Transformations that lead to equivalent systems: 
transformations that we can do on a given system to get a different system, that will be equivalent to the system prior to the transformations are:
1. Changing the order of two equations within the system
2. Multiplying an equation with a non-null number
3. Multiplying an equation with a non-null number and adding it to a different equation.
